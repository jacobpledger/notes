# Travel Safety

## Planning Your Trip:
* Research the country you are going to. Familiarize yourself with its laws and customs.
* Select hotels carefully. They should be situated in well-known and safe areas.
* Make a copy of airline tickets, driver’s licence and credit cards. Keep these separate from the originals.
* Establish points of contact. Someone should know your whereabouts at all times and be provided with contact information on where to reach you.
* Know important phone numbers (i.e. Health and Life Insurance, police, ambulance and hospitals of travelling destinations).
* Know location of Canadian Embassy and other safe places where you can find refuge and assistance.
* Bring a “Give Away” wallet, purse, and money.

## While on Your Trip:
* Keep a low profile and protect your identity. Avoid discussing personal and background information.
* Do not use street ATMs.
* Know how to use local phone and carry “local phone” change at all times. When using pay phone, turn around and face those around you.
* Travel in a group whenever possible.
* Walk on well-lit, heavily traveled streets. Avoid alleys or side streets.
* Keep informed about international events.
* Do not display any outward vestiges of wealth which contrasts with those of the country in which you are travelling. (i.e. money, clothes, jewellery, etc).

## At Air Terminals:
* Use concealed bag tags.
* Spend as little time as possible in airports.
* Do not leave your belongings unattended.
* Stay away from unattended luggage, trash containers, lockers, windows, and glass walls.

## At Hotels:
* Use valet parking whenever possible. Otherwise park close to hotel access point.
* Do not place ID or credit cards on counter for strangers to see.
* Avoid ground / first floor and high floors in Third World locations.
* Use elevators rather than stairwells. Stand near the elevator control panel so if threatened, you can push the alarm button.
* Keep your room key in your possession at all times.
* Report lost keys immediately and consider changing rooms.
* Do not accept deliveries to your room unless previously arranged.
* When room is vacant, leave your lights or music on and pull curtains.
* Read fire/safety instructions.

## Travelling in Vehicles:
* Driving is not advisable in some higher risk and Third World locations.
* In some Third World countries, do not use public transportation.
* Drive on top half of gas tank. Refuel during daylight or at well lighted service stations.
* Check the interior before entering your vehicle.
* Lock doors and have a cell phone.
* Place packages in the trunk.
* Place bags on the floor, never on the seat.
* Avoid dark remote parking areas such as hotel garage parking.
* If your car is bumped from behind in an isolated area, put flashers on and drive to a location where there are other people. Do not stop immediately.

## Arrested / Legal Problems:
* Do not accept anyone at face value.
* Request identification.
* Politely but firmly request access to or contact with your embassy / consulate.
* Stay calm and maintain your dignity. Do nothing to provoke authorities.
* Do not admit to anything or volunteer information.
* Do not sign anything, even if they say they will release you after you sign it.
* Do not make a firm commitment to help them in return for your release.
