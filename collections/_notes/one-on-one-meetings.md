# One-On-One Meetings
## In General:
* If it’s not awkward, you’re doing it wrong. Ideally get both people to commit to saying something awkward in every 1:1. Talk about feelings, both good and bad. 
* Don’t talk about things you could discuss in the open. 
* Keep it casual. 
* Track your time so you can optimize meeting planning.
* Be consistent. Make it a priority. 
* Come prepared with an agenda or notes of things you want/need to discuss. Consider doing this collaboratively. 
* Leave with action items
* Write up a summary of what was discussed. Send it to the other person.

## As a Manager
Don’t just talk *to* them, ask about:
* Their preferred work habits
	* Are there certain times of day when their energy lags?
	* Do they absolutely loathe specific tasks?
* Their Work Happiness
* Short and long-term goals
	* Ask about how current project is or what they want to tackle next. 
	* Ask about 5 years, what’s next. 
* Ask about possible improvements, to anything.
	* Are there any ways I can make your job easier?
	* Is my involvement in your daily tasks enough? Too much?
	* Is there any aspect of my management style that bothers you?
